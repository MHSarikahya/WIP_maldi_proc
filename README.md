# WIP_maldi_proc
WIP_maldi_proc - do not use as is, experimental

Automating peak alignment of exp m/z with theoretical m/z

  Does not always work, do not use as is.
  
  Requires full understanding of what the data you are looking at is,
  will readily fail if tolerance values are incorrect.
  
  Wide variability in tolerance values will give you WRONG results.
  
  Do not implicitely trust the values pulled with this specific code.
  
  Purely experimental, will attempt to fix in the future.
